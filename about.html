            <p>
                Hey, Johannes here. At the start of 2025, I began writing these monthly reflections—just because it felt right. After refining the process over a few months, I've realized how valuable those hours really are. You learn a lot when you start tracking your own life. Trying to hold everything in your head doesn't work—at least not for long.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why I started this blog: to map things out and share what's going on with me. And here's the cool part—sometimes people write back. They share what they've been through in similar situations, and it gives you a new perspective. A reminder that you're not the only one figuring stuff out.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h3 class="about-caption">If I Could Give You One Piece of Advice</h3>
            <p>
                Have confidence in yourself. Seriously. Most of the time, the only thing holding you back is you. Trust your gut, take the leap, and don't be afraid to mess up. That's where the good stuff happens.
            </p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h3 class="about-caption">A Short Bio</h3>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Munich, Germany in 2002. I had the best childhood ever—growing up with my parents and two brothers (I'm the sandwich in the middle).
            </p>
            <p>
                After high school, I moved to Kaiserslautern in 2020 to study mathematics at RPTU. Even though it's a quiet place, it was one of the best decisions of my life. That's where I really started to evolve as a person and learned a lot about myself and the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had the opportunity to do an exchange semester in Singapore, which was a huge catalyst for growth. I wasn't even 20 yet, and there I was—on my own in a new country. Still a super safe environment, but an important step for this young man.
            </p>
            <p>
                After some time back in Germany to finish my bachelor's, another highlight was my next stay abroad in Málaga, Spain. I wrote my thesis remotely from there. Getting to know a culture in two months on steroids—I loved it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't really have a clue how I wanted to proceed from there, so I took the safe route and started a master's in Data Science, Statistics, and Decision Analysis at Stockholm University. Mostly because I didn't see any better alternatives at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, here I am, writing this after spending eight months in Stockholm. My master's degree is deep in the making. The time here has been relatively unspectacular, which was also good in its own way. Every situation opens up new opportunities—no matter if you think it's good or bad. Knowing this, I shape the way I live.
            </p>
            <p>
                The more steps I took, the more I realized: I can go anywhere and I'll thrive. I'll make it. I'll be happy. And so can you. One of the best things for improvement is having data to look back on, or seeing how other people did a specific thing. This is my attempt to track parts of my life, which is mainly beneficial for me. But who knows—maybe someone will be grateful I published this stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish you nothing but a wonderful life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Best!<br>
