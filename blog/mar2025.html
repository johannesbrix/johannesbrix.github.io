            Welcome to ReflectionV2. I planned to sit down one time every week and collect what had happened over the last week. I wanted to break down this big task of writing the report into smaller pieces and get the benefit of ending this chapter quickly to move to new, fresh chapters.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In theory, this sounds nice, but looking back, I realize I just wrote too much and spent too much time reflecting rather than doing stuff. I had too much stuff and in the end decided to cut out a lot and focus on the basics. You are busy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I like how Swedish schools approach this: they do not tell the students that they have to write a minimum of x words, no. They teach the more valuable skill of writing a maximum number of words. Condensing your message in a specific frame. This was my task too.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Note: Feel free to share your thoughts on whatever comes to your mind when reading this, or share what has happened in your last month.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As always, I love to hear from you!<br>
            Best!<br>
            Johannes

        <h2>In a nutshell:</h2>
        <p>
            I spent the beginning of March at home, celebrated Fasching and my dad's birthday, and then left to return to Stockholm. I wrote 2 exams to finish 2 courses (I am now done with 50% of all of my master's courses!), read a lot of books, went on a hike, enjoyed spending time outside, and had plenty of realizations along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
            As always, a lot has happened again. Let's get started.
        </p>

        <h3>Return home:</h3>
        <p>
            My dad surprised me by picking me up from the train. Great gesture. It felt very good to be at home again after 2 months! I have never regretted putting something in the calendar by booking flights or whatever. I am happy that I didn't wait until Easter to come home again.
        </p>

        <h3>Grandpa:</h3>
        <p>
            My first grandmother passed away last year at 88, my grandpa is 89 now, and he is very old and weak. It is crazy how time flies. At the beginning of COVID, we were still doing a workout together in our basement.
        </p>

        <h3>Siddhartha und Lego:</h3>
        <p>
            This year, I got a special birthday gift from a highly appreciated friend. Turned out to be an even greater joy than expected. I was building this town like in the old childhood days while listening to the audiobook Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. It was a magical experience. I started at 8:00 p.m. and finished 3 hours later, but continued to finish the 5-hour-long audiobook in one go, because I was so drawn to the story & the amazing narrator.
        </p>

        <h3>Birthday of Papa:</h3>
        <p>
            My father celebrated his 59th birthday, and it was a blast to see the family and his friends come together again after a while.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think, especially in this age, many people often become comfortable with not strengthening their connections with their loved ones. That's why it is especially crucial to take the opportunity and celebrate together with those amazing people whenever we can and as long as we can. #grandpa
        </p>

        <h3>Return to Stockholm:</h3>
        <p>
            My father made the hero move and brought me to the train station in the morning at 5:30 after his birthday party, which I highly appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took the digital train ticket from my brother because you can access it via multiple devices, but I still had no official document to prove that I am the student "Andreas Brix". Destiny wanted to let me meet ticket inspectors in a very special way. I had to change trains, and while waiting for the train, 2 ticket inspectors placed themselves right next to me. I was thinking to myself that if I go in with full confidence and show how I walk in with them like everyone, they should assume that I have a clean sheet. In the end, we were both waiting in the standing area across from each other. I was waiting for them to make the move, but they suddenly left and never appeared again. What a ride!
        </p>
        <p>
            I went home fast and met our new roommate, Ellis from the Netherlands, who is nice. I am now the longest living inhabitant in the flat, together with Widad. Time flies!
        </p>

        <h3>Youtube:</h3>
        <p>
            How I approach YouTube right now does not feel right. However, I know that I should use YouTube in some way. I either make videos out of necessity to do them, rather than feeling that what I am doing is the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I am currently building up a team out of a few creators, and we meet up every 2 weeks. This has been very valuable, and that's where I currently see my role: bringing together those talented video makers so they can become great in their craft, and I can connect them in the background.
        </p>
        <p>
            You tackle those challenges, and they never turn out as expected. But it will always be good in some way!
        </p>

        <h3>My Master's Degree:</h3>
        <p>
            My degree here is a wild ride between hating and loving it. And it all comes down to how I look at things because the situation did not change. To be honest, I don't like the material and quality of what they teach me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently look at things from the Johannes Brix perspective, I usually know myself: positive. Only then can you see all those opportunities lying around waiting to be collected by you. From hating those courses, I switched my mindset to: It is incredible how little time you have to invest in this. You have so much free time in which you can do so many great things. This is incredible. It took a while to adapt this mindset, but I am thriving right now. It had the side effect that I enjoyed my time here way more. Ready to rock the last 10 weeks here!
        </p>

        <h3>What a world we live in:</h3>
        <p>
            During the exam prep, I was watching YouTube tutorials and was thinking to myself: what a world we live in. The Indian guy teaches me how to do Data Science. Thank you, Krish Naik. Also, another good thing about my degree: I can choose my teachers. :)
        </p>

        <h3>Degree of life:</h3>
        <p>
            I have an incredible opportunity to learn as much as possible now in those 2 ¬Ω months in front of me to learn as much as possible about stuff I always wanted to learn and "didn't have time for," or let's better say was not my main priority.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to get a fundamental overview of topics like religion, science, politics, history, design, and a few more. I fucking enjoy it right now.
        </p>

        <h3>The moment's camera:</h3>
        <p>
            I love to capture basic moments, f.e, recently in my classroom, so I can capture my situation back then. My GoPro is my pocket camera again. It is really good.
        </p>

        <h3>Summer School in Oxford and Exchange at TUM:</h3>
        <p>
            I applied for a one-week summer school in Oxford in June on economic networks and got accepted. Interesting stuff! Furthermore, I got accepted for doing an Erasmus in MUNICH! About to become one of the first pioneers in doing an Erasmus in their hometown! :)
        </p>

        <h3>Constant change - Realization about my Stay in Stockholm:</h3>
        <p>
            I just realized again how much I have changed. Almost 3 years ago, in Singapore, I was out every single day, spending time with my friends, doing everything I could to spend time around people. I fucking loved it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I spend more time with books than friends. This is perfectly fine for now, and I am super happy and fulfilled right now. I know that this will only be a phase, but an interesting observation, I didn't think a while ago that something like this would be possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Focusing on the basics - AI:</h3>
        <p>
            I changed my attitude towards AI in general, which made me move away a bit from using it. I try to use it as minimalistic as possible now. When I had to code again, I realized just how bad I've become at debugging. I was used to just throwing it in the next LLM and seeing what it had to tell me instead of trying to understand the error myself. Sometimes this can be good, but this is pure poison in the process of learning something. To have something that does the hard work for you. But hard work is required to grow muscle.
        </p>

        <h3>Sport Comeback:</h3>
        <p>
            I've been training every day since the 2nd of March. Mostly running, without Strava, tracking only when running with friends. After I slipped while running with my phone, I want to run without anything in my hands. xD
        </p>

        <h3>Finances:</h3>
        <p>
            I currently try to be more aware of how I spend my money.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unnecessary cuts:</b> I stopped having a gym membership, since I will run more and go to the outdoor gym. I also don't extend my SL ticket 3-month subscription and cycle around instead.</li>
            <li><b>Travel:</b> I still have a lot of expenses in front of me: NUS trip, Spain trip, maybe G√∂teborg too, America, Oxford, travelling home back and forth on Easter, it just adds up a lot quickly.</li>
            <li><b>Investing:</b> I cashed out my entire portfolio in December last year, also to restructure my investment portfolio for time efficiency (with index funds). I made my first investment in stocks again. I bought Zalando, Grab, and MSCI World. I am now invested again with one-third of my capital and 2 thirds in cash.</li>
            <li><b>Budget:</b> I also live here with 1200 Euros per month from my parents, which is a great privilege to have. But I have been without any regular extra income since last April. It works and is quite convenient, but I have to find a way to make money again and see value in it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Articles:</h3>
        <p>
            Read articles from my dad about Arnold Schwarzenegger's tools for success, MBAs, a critical view on Elon Musk's DOGE organization, Fusion technology in Bavaria, a critical report on X (interview of Tristan Harris).
        </p>
        <p>
            Read an incredible article about why the German "Schuldenbremse" (not allowing the state to take any extra capital) by Ludovic Subran. Simple key message: to make the investments to bring the economy forward, the state needs to take loans. The message is simple, but you can see that he is a smart guy.
        </p>

        <h3>Books:</h3>
        <p>
            Made a content consumption list of books or areas I want to study. It will be a long way from them:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finished "Gemeinsame Momente", a small book by my friend Stefan Klotz</li>
            <li>Read the first few stories of the bible</li>
            <li>Continued reading "Napoleon the Great" by Andrew Robertson</li>
            <li>Started "Investing in a changing climate" by Ludovic Subran</li>
            <li>Started "About Law" by Tony Honor√©</li>
